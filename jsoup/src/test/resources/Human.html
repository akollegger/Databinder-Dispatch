    <h1>To err is human, to forgive divine</h2>
    <font face="Arial, Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000080 size=3>
        <p>The verb &quot;<b>err</b>&quot; means to do something wrong; to make a mistake is &quot;<b>to err</b>&quot;.
        &quot;<b>To err is human</b>&quot; because all people (&quot;<b>humans</b>&quot;) make mistakes.
        <p>&quot;<b>To err is human, to forgive divine</b>&quot; says we should try hard to forgive others because all
        people are human and make mistakes.
        <p><i><b>Example:</i></b> &quot;I am still angry about what my manager did yesterday!&quot; Answer: &quot;It is best to just
        let it go; <b> to err is human, to forgive divine</b>.&quot; The world of people is &quot;<b>human</b>&quot;
        and the world of God is &quot;<b>divine</b>&quot;.
        <p>God's special power to forgive people for their mistakes is <i>called &quot;<b>divine</i></b>&quot; mercy.
        When we forgive other people we are acting &quot;<b>divine</b>&quot;. &quot;<b>To err is human, to forgive
        divine</b>&quot; says that we are all human and we all make mistakes so we should all try hard to forgive other
        people when they make mistakes.
        <p><b><i>Example:</b></i> &quot;I will never forgive my mother for what she has done!&quot;
        <p><h3>Answer:</h2>
        <li>&quot;Don't be angry at her. <b>To err is human, to forgive divine</b>.&quot; (Because we use the
        word &quot;<b>is</b>&quot; in the first phrase &quot;to err <b> is</b> human&quot; we do not use &quot;<b>is</b>&quot; again in the second phrase:
        &quot;<b>to forgive divine</b>&quot;.) We are all people who make mistakes so to forgive others when they make
        mistakes is the right thing to do; &quot;<b>to err is human, to forgive divine</b>.&quot;
