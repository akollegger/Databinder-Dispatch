### Breaking Changes

If using the `</>` verb to parse XML, you must now bring it into scope
explicitly:

    import dispatch.XhtmlParsing._

There's a good reason for this! (See below.)

### JSoup and TagSoup modules

Thanks to a [big contribution from daros][soup], Dispatch now
integrates with parsers that can handle real-world HTML. The handler
verb `</>` is used across all HTML parsers, resolved by its imported
implicit conversions. For usage instructions and examples, see the
Dispatch documentation for [TagSoup][tagsoup] and [JSoup][jsoup].

### Support byte arrays for POST

This [contribution by dyross][ary] (no relation?) adds

    def << (contents: Array[Byte])

to the standard set of request verbs.
