This beta release updates Dispatch's HttpClient dependency to 4.1
final, and adds support for the NIO [HttpAsyncClient][async]. Support
for Scala 2.7.x is dropped in this line.

There are now four standard varieties of http executors available in
different modules:

    dispatch.Http
    dispatch.nio.Http
    dispatch.thread.Http
    dispatch.gae.Http

Typical usage would be:

    import dispatch._
    val http = new nio.Http

[Request][Request] itself has been substantially refactored. It is now only a
class with properties and a copy method. All of the request-building
operations ("verbs") are [added via implicit conversions][requests],
putting the core module on the same plane as internal and external
extension modules.

### Callbacks and futures

The `thread` and `nio` executors return [stoppable futures][stoppable]
from their `apply` and other request executions, allowing persistent
connections to be easily closed. A new alternative to request handlers
is [dispatch.Callback][callback], which defines a callback function to
receive request data as it arrives. For example, the fundamental
response callback accepting bytes:

[stoppable]: http://sourced.implicit.ly/net.databinder/dispatch-futures/0.8.0.Beta3/Futures.scala.html#9092
[callback]: http://sourced.implicit.ly/net.databinder/dispatch-core/0.8.0.Beta3/dispatch/callbacks.scala.html

    h(:/("example.com") ^ (response, bytes, length) => { ... } )

There are more convenient callbacks that convert the bytes to strings,
and buffer them into single lines:

    h(:/("example.com") ^-- println)

You can also return a value from the stoppable future produced, by
defining a finishing function:

    h(:/("example.com") ^-- println ^> { res => "all done!" })

But if what you want is a finished response object, it's much easier
to just use the standard response handlers. These work with the NIO
interface by buffering the response in memory. So this works with any
of the executors:

    import dispatch.liftjson.Js._
    h(:/("example.com") ># { js => ... })

With the `thread` and `nio` executors, the current thread continues
while the request is performed in a background or IO thread. The
handler function is called with the completed request object (in this
case a JValue) as soon as it is available.

The [080 branch][twine] of the twine example application uses the new
stoppable future / callback interface with an NIO executor to connect
to Twitter [User Streams](http://dev.twitter.com/pages/user_streams).

### Breaking changes

The `Http` object is no longer accessible from all modules, so the
implicit conversions that were found there are now in `Request`.

One change that is likely to break some client code (sorry!) is
the `<<` and `<<?` verbs which previously took a `Map[String, Any]`
now take an `Iterable[(String, String)]`. So you can still use a Map
if you like, it just has to be a map of strings to strings or you'll
get compilation errors. The more permissive typing, which made use of
`Any#toString`, was the source of common errors in application code
where non-trivial objects (often, functions) were unknowingly added.

And lastly, it was necessary to rename the method for adding OAuth
tokens to a query string from `<<?` to [with_token][with_token], and
all of the [Mime-posting methods][mime] from `<<` to `<<*`. In Scala
2.8.0 the implicit conversion fails to resolve the overlapping names
with the refactored Request structure. This is fixed in 2.8.1, but
we'd like to support 2.8.0.
