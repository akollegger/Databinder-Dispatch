* Fixed regression in NIO handler futures introduced in 0.8.2. An
  exception was thrown after otherwise successful buffered stream
  request handling.
* Fixed bug in NIO handler that would in some cases allow `apply()` to
  return null after exceptions were recorded. Applying the NIO future
  will now throw any recorded exceptions, as intended.
